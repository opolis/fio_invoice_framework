# Fio Invoice Framework
ETHDenver 2021 framework for the FIO Invoice Integration Bounty with Opolis

## Goal
The goal of this project is to integrate the `fio_invoice_framework.models.Invoice` model  with the [FIO Request network](https://fioprotocol.io/).
- Pay payroll invoices, as issued by Opolis, with crypto from a memberâ€™s LLC to an Opolis FIO Address in DAI, USDT, or USDC
- Give the Opolis platform the ability to issue a FIO Request for an invoice to be paid in DAI, USDT, or USDC by a Member LLC
 

## Models
Below are the stripped down versions of Opolis's database models. Please use these models as guidelines for building
the project, however, do not feel restricted by these models. Feel free to add more Models or fields to existing models if needed. 
 
> `django.contrib.auth.models.User`

This is django's default User model. You can find more details [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/#user-model).
All auth data related to Opolis's members is stored in this model.

- `name`: Legal name of the LLC.
- `created_at`: The time when the instance was created.
- `updated_at`: The time when the instance was modified.
